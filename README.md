# COVID-19-Scanner


The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2.
I have developed an iOS application using Deep Learning that can detect Pneumonia caused by NCOV-19 from x-Ray Images. It will help people to verify from the Pneumonia X-ray images whether it contains NCOV-19 or not. The model I used is currently a proof-of-concept that displays great accuracy, though with a very small test dataset. I need more data to improve its accuracy hence, please connect me to anyone you know that can potentially provide more COVID-19 images for model testing and training, or who can benefit from the model for their research.[The model seriously needs further validation from bigger and more diverse test sets because I had too few x-ray images (with overwhelmingly healthy and normal lungs) to test the model on. I hope someone can do further testing and improve my model once it fails!!!]

I need more data to make the model more accurate. Kindly connect me if you get sample data.
